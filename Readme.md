# Problem Statement

Have you ever heard of the famous novel “Around the World in Eighty Days” by Jules Verne?

The novel features a character named Phileas Fogg, a wealthy and eccentric Englishman who bets half his fortune (£20,000) that he can travel around the world in 80 days.

The novel has also been adapted into a popular TV show which is quite entertaining to watch 😃.

Our task is to plot the route that the protagonist takes to travel around the world within 80 days.
